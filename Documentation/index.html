            <h1>Welcome to FX.php!</h1>
            <p>
                FX.php was originally created in 2001 as an alternative to the proprietary, buggy, and under-powered
                options that were then available to FileMaker developers who wanted to put their data on the web.  At
                the time, PHP was portrayed by some purveyors of these options as harder to use, and perhaps even a bit
                scary.  How times have changed.  These days, PHP is the standard for FileMaker web development (though
                there are people using other options.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay, so you've got your hands on FX.php; now what?  If you're already a seasoned web developer, you may
                be more appealing to dangerous, man-eating beasts!  Or maybe not.  It probably depends on the seasoning
                (and the beast, for that matter.)  Regardless, if you're in that boat, you may want to jump straight
                into the <a href="functions.html">functions documentation</a>.  If you're still here, I'm going to
                assume that you're fairly new to web development, PHP, or both; though you may be quite familiar with
                FileMaker, or some other sort of development.
