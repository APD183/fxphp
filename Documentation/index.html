            <h2>Welcome to FX.php!</h2>
            <p>
                FX.php was originally created in 2001 as an alternative to the proprietary, buggy, and under-powered
                options that were then available to FileMaker&reg; developers who wanted to put their data on the web. At
                the time, PHP was portrayed by some purveyors of these options as harder to use, and perhaps even a bit
                scary.  How times have changed.  These days, PHP is the standard for FileMaker&reg; web development
                (though there are people using other options, too.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay, so you've got your hands on FX.php; now what?  If you're already a seasoned web developer, you may
                be more appealing to dangerous, man-eating beasts!  Or maybe not.  It probably depends on the seasoning
                (and the beast, for that matter.)  Regardless, if you're in that boat, you may want to jump straight
                into the <a href="functions.html">functions documentation</a>.  If you're still here, I'm going to
                assume that you're fairly new to web development, PHP, or both; though you may be quite familiar with
                FileMaker&reg; databases, or some other sort of development.
            </p>
            <p>
                FX.php is a database abstraction class.  Basically, that means it&apos;s a way to talk to a whole bunch
                of different data sources in (more or less) the same way.  It will even write the most basic SQL
                statements for you.  No kidding. If FX.php doesn&apos;t support your data source of choice yet, feel
                free to request it; or just code the support yourself and submit it over on
                <a href="https://github.com/yodarunamok/fxphp">github</a> &mdash; FX is open source, after all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, as a result of FX.php&apos;s origins (among other things), a fair bit of what you see here will
                be aimed at folks who develop with FileMaker&reg; Pro. If you&apos;re not in that boat (that&apos;s two
                boats so far, for those of you keeping score), and/or you&apos;re not familiar with FileMaker&reg; stuff
                in general, this next bit is for you.  FileMaker&reg; databases are aimed at work groups, and as such it
                competes with products like Microsoft Access, though it scales better (up to millions of records), and
                is <strong>much</strong> easier to use. Successful FileMaker&reg; developers can be found with most any
                training and background. In short, it&apos;s a great place to start if you&apos;re a small business
                owner in need of database software.
