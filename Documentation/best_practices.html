            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use all the available tools.</strong>
                </li>

            <h4>FileMaker Database Design</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Make web optimized layouts.</strong> With FileMaker, every field on the specified layout is
                    returned when you perform a query. So, for best performance, create separate layouts for your web
                    queries.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Performance &amp; Query Optimization</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Avoid returning large found sets.</strong> Use the optional, third parameter of
                    <span class="code">SetDBData()</span> to break found sets into reasonable chunks; then either provide
                    a paging interface, or use AJAX (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to pull additional records as users
                    scroll through your page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Make smart use of field/column indexing.</strong> Unless your data set is never going to
                    grow, searching on a non-indexed field is asking for trouble. Also, become familiar with the types of
                    indexing offered by your data source of choice &mdash; there may be options, other than the default,
                    that work better for your needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Be careful about how you use relationships.</strong> Sometimes, there is no substitute for
                    relational data in a query (that&apos;s why we use relational databases, right?) On the other hand,
                    relational data <em>will</em> slow your queries, so be judicious in your use of all that power.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Test your queries during development.</strong> Keep in mind that people are used to quick
                    responses from web pages, and web browsers will give up if your pages take too long to load. In some
                    cases, caching may make sense (there's a MySQL caching class for FileMaker&reg; databases in the EXTRAS
                    directory of this distribution, and there are other options out there.) And when testing, check both
                    common and uncommon text &mdash; you may be surprised at the results.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use the right database software for the job.</strong> FileMaker&reg; databases scale to millions
                    of records, MySQL can handle more, and PostgreSQL scales further still. For truly massive data sets,
                    you may need to look at a NoSQL option. Keep in mind that if you need to move to a different option
                    down-the-line, FX.php is designed to move with you.
